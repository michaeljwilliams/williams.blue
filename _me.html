    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm a designer, developer, and user experience activist. I love making the Web a better place by creating elegant, functional designs and user experiences and easy-to-use, fast websites. I also enjoy sharing <a href="#/_posts.html">my ideas</a> and <a href="#/_work.html">my work</a>. <a href="mailto:33a1eb@williams.blue">Send me an email!</a>
        <br><br>
        In my spare time I like to read, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/mwilliaams">listen to music</a>, play guitar, and explore the great outdoors.
        <br><br>
        I live in sunny San Diego and know of only two seasons: "Warm" and "Hot".
        <br><br>
