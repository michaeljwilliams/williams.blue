    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm a designer, developer, and user experience activist. I love making the Web a better place by creating elegant, functional designs and user experiences and easy-to-use, fast websites. I also enjoy sharing <a href="/posts/index.html">my ideas</a> and <a href="/portfolio/index.html">my work</a>. <a href="mailto:33a1eb@williams.blue">Send me an email!</a>
