                After a tough two years of finishing my college education at UC San Diego, I have finally graduated with a bachelor's degree in Cognitive Science! Wait...what is cognitive science??

                <code>:hover</code> isn't really dead. Its potential and real-world usage has tapered off, but it still has a place in our code. <code>:hover</code> is like the Man In Blackâ€”as Miracle Max would say, it just so happens that our friend here is only <em>mostly</em> dead.
